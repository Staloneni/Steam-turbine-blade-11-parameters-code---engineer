# Steam-turbine-blade-11-parameters-code---engineer
This code generates blade airfoils using eleven parameters. The blades are generated for steam turbines in simple geometry. The code was written in Fortran version 95. The source code comes from L. J. Pritchard's "An Eleven Parameter Axial Turbine Airfoil Geometry Model".
